        "description": "The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.",

        "name": "Fili and Kili",
        "description": "Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company. As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. It was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains. With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking Thranduil.[4] They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they reached Lake-town.[5] The brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by the river.[6] At the feet of the Lonely Mountain, Fíli and Kíli scouted Ravenhill and found the Front Gate with Balin and Bilbo. Also, with Bilbo, they found the side-door leading into the mountain. Both brothers were killed while defending the mortally wounded Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle of Five Armies, and all three were later buried with honor",
